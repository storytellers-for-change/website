        <p>
          <strong>Stories for Change: Interactive Storytelling for Social Impact</strong> is a one-day
          workshop uniting researchers, designers, and activists to prototype interactive narratives
          that deeply engage audiences on issues of poverty, inequality, and climate resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
          We move beyond data and awareness: by weaving choice and consequence into story, we empower
          participants to shift from passive spectators into active agents of change. 
          This workshop investigates interactive storytelling as a powerful tool for enhancing public engagement with pressing social issues, such as poverty, inequality, and climate change. 
          Despite widespread awareness and access to data, these challenges persist, highlighting the need for innovative, creative approaches that move beyond mere information dissemination. 
          Recognizing that social change requires deeper engagement and empathy, this workshop will explore both established and emerging design methodologies aimed at activating meaningful participation in social change initiatives. 
          By convening a diverse group of researchers and practitioners, we aim to co-create a research agenda focused on enhancing engagement and fostering self-efficacy within communities. 
          Through collaborative discussions and hands-on activities, participants will share insights and develop innovative strategies and shape a future research agenda. 
          Ultimately, this workshop seeks to build a vibrant community committed to advancing practical solutions for social impact, bridging the gap between design practices and community needs.

        <p>
          Because the organizers are primarily based in Europe and Southern Asia, we have chosen to align the workshop schedule with the European workday, and all indicated times will be expressed as UTC+01:00.  
          While we acknowledge that time zone constraints may pose challenges, we feel the benefits of real-time collaboration and one-on-one interactions outweigh these limitations. 
          If the schedule does not work for an interested participant, we encourage them to reach out. 
          We are happy to explore individualized solutions, such as involvement in pre- and post-workshop activities, to ensure everyone can contribute meaningfully.

    <!-- Workshop Themes -->
    <section id="themes" class="section themes">
      <div class="section-content">
        <h2 class="fluid">Themes</h2>
        <p>
          Our day is organized around three core themes—each addressing a vital dimension of interactive
          storytelling and its potential for social impact:
        </p>
        <ul class="themes">
          <li>
            <h3>Transforming Awareness to Action</h3>
            <p>
              This theme explores how interactive storytelling can enhance awareness, self-efficacy and dialogue to catalyze action addressing societal challenges.
              How do we challenge assumptions and encourage genuine “ah-ha” moments that can inspire empathy or unlock new insights? 
            </p>
            <p>
              How can we move people from simply knowing about an issue to doing something about it? In this theme, we’ll explore how narrative formats—across digital, physical, or hybrid mediums—can activate a sense of agency and motivate real-world engagement. 
              Stories can make systemic issues personal, clarify complex information, and build the emotional momentum needed for change. Together, we’ll reflect on how storytelling strategies can empower communities, shift behaviors, and support ongoing action toward social impact.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Fostering Perspective Shifts</h3>
            <p>
              In this theme, we will experiment with creative storytelling techniques—whether it’s a narrative interface, a dialog-based storyboard, 
              or a simple everyday interaction—to show how minor disturbances or thought-provoking surprises can prompt major changes in viewpoint. 
              Instead of just persuading an audience, these approaches invite reflection and momentarily place them in someone else’s shoes. 
              By the workshop’s end, we aim to co-create small prototypes that demonstrate how to catalyze meaningful perspective shifts with minimal yet imaginative storytelling tools.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Building Culturally Relevant Narratives</h3>
            <p>
              Participants will learn to adapt storytelling techniques to different cultural contexts, ensuring narratives are respectful and relevant to varied audiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              This theme focuses on crafting stories that resonate across diverse cultural contexts. How do we ensure that our narratives are not only accessible, but also respectful, situated, and meaningful to the communities they aim to engage? 
              Through this theme, we will explore how local knowledge, values, and lived experiences can shape more inclusive and powerful storytelling strategies. 
              Participants are encouraged to reflect on how narrative forms and content can adapt to different audiences—bridging gaps, challenging stereotypes, and supporting more equitable participation in social change.
            </p>

        <h3>Call for Abstracts</h3>
        <p>
          Your abstract should describe a real-world example from your research, practice, or design work where storytelling played—or could have played—a meaningful role. 
          This could be a successful case, a surprising failure, or a situation where the right narrative approach might have made a difference.
        </p>
        <ul class="abstract-call">
          <li><strong>Context/Setting:</strong>  What was the situation or challenge? What role did (or could) storytelling play?</li>
          <li><strong>Interactive Approach:</strong> Describe your narrative design, branching logic, or media used.</li>
          <li><strong>Position Statement:</strong> Was the shift successful? If not, what barriers arose? If yes, what drove success?</li>
          <li><strong>Relevance to Themes:</strong> Indicate which workshop theme(s) your example best illustrates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We welcome submissions from all disciplines and professional backgrounds. Whether you’re working in research, activism, education, design, or community practice, we’re excited to hear your story and learn from your experience.
