        <p>
          <strong>Stories for Change: Interactive Storytelling for Social Impact</strong> is a one-day workshop
          held on <strong>June 23, 2025</strong>, as part of the 
          <a href="https://cc.acm.org/2025/workshops_programme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            ACM Creativity & Cognition 2025 Workshops Programme
          </a>.
          It unites researchers, designers, and activists to prototype interactive narratives that deeply engage
          audiences on issues of poverty, inequality, and climate resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
          We move beyond data and awareness: by weaving choice and consequence into story, we empower
          participants to shift from passive spectators into active agents of change.

    <!-- Workshop Themes -->
    <section id="themes" class="section themes">
      <div class="section-content">
        <h2 class="fluid">Themes</h2>
        <p>The workshop revolves around three core themes, each designed to deepen our understanding of interactive storytelling’s role in social impact:</p>
        <div class="themes">
          <div class="themes-item">
            <h3>Transforming Awareness to Action</h3>
            <p>This theme explores how interactive storytelling can enhance awareness, self-efficacy and dialogue to catalyze action addressing societal challenges.</p>
           <p>How can we move people from simply knowing about an issue to doing something about it? In this theme, we’ll explore how narrative formats—across digital, physical, or hybrid mediums—can activate a sense of agency and motivate real-world engagement. Stories can make systemic issues personal, clarify complex information, and build the emotional momentum needed for change. Together, we’ll reflect on how storytelling strategies can empower communities, shift behaviors, and support ongoing action toward social impact.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="themes-item">
            <h3>Fostering Perspective Shifts</h3>
            <p>This theme explores how interactive storytelling can help people see the world through fresh eyes and spark deeper understanding.</p>
            <p>How do we challenge assumptions and encourage genuine “ah-ha” moments that can inspire empathy or unlock new insights? In this theme, we will experiment with creative storytelling techniques—whether it’s a narrative interface, a dialog-based storyboard, or a simple everyday interaction—to show how minor disturbances or thought-provoking surprises can prompt major changes in viewpoint. Instead of just persuading an audience, these approaches invite reflection and momentarily place them in someone else’s shoes. By the workshop’s end, we aim to co-create small prototypes that demonstrate how to catalyze meaningful perspective shifts with storytelling tools.
</p>
          </div>
          <div class="themes-item">
            <h3>Building Culturally Relevant Narratives</h3>
            <p>Participants will learn to adapt storytelling techniques to different cultural contexts, ensuring narratives are respectful and relevant to varied audiences.</p>
            <p>How do we create stories that resonate across borders—without flattening identities or erasing difference? In this theme, we’ll explore how cultural knowledge, values, and traditions shape both how stories are told and how they’re understood. From language to aesthetics to participation, we’ll consider what it takes to build narratives that connect meaningfully with diverse audiences. Through shared examples and discussion, we’ll reflect on how storytelling can act as a bridge—connecting communities, amplifying voices, and respecting context.</p>
